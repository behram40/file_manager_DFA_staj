# Technical Report: File Management Web Application

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The File Management Web Application is a secure, full-stack web application designed to provide users with a platform to manage their files (PDF, PNG, JPG) with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### 1.2 Key Features
- User registration and authentication
- Secure file upload and management
- Support for multiple file types (PDF, PNG, JPG)
- User-specific file storage
- Real-time file preview for images
- Responsive web interface

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Frontend**: HTML, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) + Flask-Login
- **Security**: Werkzeug (password hashing)

## 3. Data Model

### 3.1 Database Schema

#### User Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### File Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE file (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    original_filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    file_type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    upload_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user (id)
);
```

### 3.2 File Storage
- Physical files are stored in the `uploads` directory
- Files are prefixed with username for uniqueness
- Maximum file size: 16MB
- Supported formats: PDF, PNG, JPG/JPEG

## 4. Security Implementation

### 4.1 Authentication
- JWT-based authentication with 1-hour token expiration
- Flask-Login for session management
- Password hashing using Werkzeug's security functions
- Secure password requirements:
  - Minimum 10 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one special character

### 4.2 Authorization
- File access control through user ownership verification
- Protected routes using `@login_required` decorator
- 403 Forbidden responses for unauthorized access attempts
- User-specific file isolation

### 4.3 File Security
- Secure filename handling
- File type validation
- MIME type verification
- User-specific file storage
- Direct file access prevention

## 5. API Endpoints

### 5.1 Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /register`: User registration
- `POST /login`: User authentication
- `GET /logout`: User logout
- `POST /check_username`: Username availability check

### 5.2 File Management Endpoints
- `GET /dashboard`: User's file dashboard
- `POST /upload`: File upload
- `GET /download/<file_id>`: File download
- `GET /preview/<file_id>`: Image preview
- `POST /delete/<file_id>`: File deletion

## 6. Frontend Implementation

### 6.1 User Interface
- Responsive design using Bootstrap 5
- Real-time form validation
- Interactive file management dashboard
- Modal-based image previews
- User feedback through flash messages

### 6.2 Client-Side Features
- Real-time username availability checking
- Password strength validation
- Password visibility toggle
- File type validation
- Confirmation dialogs for deletions

## 7. Performance Considerations

### 7.1 Database Optimization
- Indexed primary keys
- Foreign key constraints
- Efficient query patterns
- Lazy loading of relationships

### 7.2 File Handling
- File size limits (16MB)
- Asynchronous file operations
- Efficient file type checking
- Secure file storage structure

## 8. Error Handling

### 8.1 Client-Side Validation
- Form input validation
- File type validation
- Password requirement checking
- Username availability checking

### 8.2 Server-Side Validation
- Database constraint enforcement
- File type verification
- Authentication checks
- Authorization verification

### 8.3 Error Responses
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid input
- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required
- 403 Forbidden: Authorization denied
- 404 Not Found: Resource not found
- 413 Payload Too Large: File size exceeded

## 9. Future Improvements

### 9.1 Potential Enhancements
- File encryption at rest
- Two-factor authentication
- File sharing capabilities
- File versioning
- Cloud storage integration
- API rate limiting
- Enhanced file preview capabilities
- Batch file operations

### 9.2 Scalability Considerations
- Database migration to PostgreSQL
- File storage migration to cloud storage
- Caching implementation
- Load balancing
- CDN integration for static files

## 10. Conclusion

The File Management Web Application provides a secure and efficient solution for user file management. The implementation follows security best practices and provides a robust foundation for future enhancements. The system's architecture ensures data integrity, user privacy, and secure file handling while maintaining a user-friendly interface.
